	// Parts
		#LCT-pod-titl = SpaceX Duna Colonial Transporter
		#LCT-pod-desc = Kerbin's greatest achievement - the 50-person, 7 meter Duna Colonial Transporter is designed for the colonization of any planetary body. Designed to be used for return trips, accomodates an 8-person crew plus 42 passengers with a PICA-X heatshield built in for atmospheric returns and enough monopropellant on board for a fully-powered soft landing when equipped with UltraDraco engines.

		#LCT-Chute-titl = Colonial Transporter Parachute
		#LCT-Chute-desc = Large parachute designed to be attached to Colonial Transport spacecraft for emergency and atmospheric planetary soft landings.
