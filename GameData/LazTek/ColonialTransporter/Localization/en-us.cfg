	// Parts
		#ColonialTransporter-lct-pod-titl = SpaceX Duna Colonial Transporter
		#ColonialTransporter-lct-pod-desc = Kerbin's greatest achievement - the 50-person, 7 meter Duna Colonial Transporter is designed for the colonization of any planetary body. Designed to be used for return trips, accomodates an 8-person crew plus 42 passengers with a PICA-X heatshield built in for atmospheric returns and enough monopropellant on board for a fully-powered soft landing when equipped with UltraDraco engines.

		#LTC-Chute-titl = Colonial Transporter Parachute
		#LTC-Chute-desc = Large parachute designed to be attached to Colonial Transport spacecraft for emergency and atmospheric planetary soft landings.

		#LTC-dock-titl = SpaceX Dragon Ring Docking Port
		#LTC-dock-desc = Docking port for SpaceX Dragon spacecraft, also connects to medium-sized docking ports.

		#LTC-eng-draco-rcs-desc = Next-generation combination of twin UltraDraco engines and RCS control in a nacelle radial mount to attach to Colonial Transporter capsule in a set of 4. Using monopropellant for fuel, these are designed to be used as emergency escape thrusters and powered landings as well as providing reaction control.
		#LTC-eng-draco-desc = Next-generation twin UltraDraco engines and nacelle radial mount to attach to Colonial Transport capsule in an opposing set of 2. Using monopropellant for fuel, these are designed to be used as emergency escape thrusters or for powered landings.
